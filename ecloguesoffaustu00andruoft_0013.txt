PREFACE

THANKs to the liberal policy of the Johns Hopkins Press,
Ι am able to make this third contributio-n to the history of
the humanistic Pastoral.

The name of Faustus Andrelinus is less familiar than that
of either ‘⁴ good old Mantuan '’ or Sannazaro3 he never en-
joyed the farne and the influence of the one, he never ap-
proached the high poetic plane of the other. And yet in his
own day and generation he was a very important personage.
One of the Italian scholars who helped to spread the New
Learning in France, professor for many years in the Univer-
sity of Paris⁷ the intimate friend of Erasmus, the special
protege of the King and Queen—dz'u regnavit Lutetiae.
His Eclogues are always readable‚ because they contain
a certain amount of autobiography‚ and reflect many of his
own experiences in Italy and France. They are interesting
because of their ‘moral’ tone, with occasional bits of pro-
verbial wisdom and frequent echoes of the great Roman
Satirists. And they hold an important place in the tradition
of the Pastoral‚ because of their frequent imitation of Cal-
purnius and Nemesianus—at a time when these two poets
were not very widely read.

My Text is based on a comparison of the Paris edition
of 1506 with a rotograph copy of the text published by
J. Oporinus, Basel, 1546. In a few passages I have adopted
the reading of Josentius Josa's edition, Lyons, 1530. The
spelling is modified to suit the convenience of the modern
reader. The punctuation is my own.

My Notes are mainly concerned with the question of
Andrelinus' sourceS, and only occasionally serve to explain
his meaning. Ι have paid some attention to his fondness for
proverbial expressions, and Ι have tried to indicate some of
the traces of his Italian origin. Indeed, there is more than
one passage (e. g. vii. 44) where without some knowledge
of Italian it would be hard to guess his meaning at all.
