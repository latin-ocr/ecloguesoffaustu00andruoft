8 PREFA CE

The Appendices are added to give a part of the historical
background of the Eclogues. Ι have modernized the spell-
ing and punctuation of these documents‚ but Ι have been
careful not to interfere with anyone's diction⁷ syntax, or
meaning. It is mere chance, not design, that my edition
will help to mark the fourth centenary of the poet's death.

The four rather prosaic Eclogues of Ioannes Arnolletus
are really added as a sort of appendix. They show that
Andrelinus had at least one close imitator. And they show
that, like Andrelinus, their author was a careful student of
Calpurnius and Nemesianus, The text is based on roto-
graph copies of the editions published by Badius Ascensffls,
Paris, 1524, and J. Oporinus, Basel, 1546, and on my own
copy of the Poematia published by Robert winter, BaseL

I have three people to thank for special help in the mak-
ing of this book: Professor JOHN L. GERIG, of Columbia
University‚ Mr. Ε. Η. W. MEYERSTEIN. of the British
Museum, and M. CH. MORTET‚ of the Bibliotheque Ste-
Genevieve⁷ Paris.
