The title of the book seems to say that in 1524 Arnollet
was principal of a school 01 Ν ον015.35 And it may perhaps
be inferred from his poenis that he was a native of Nevers,
that 110 lived ior a time in the “ agri Fiscalienses ’', and that
about 1520, or a little earlier, he returned to his native
town.3⁶

The Bucolica were printed again in Robert Winter’s
Poematia aliquot insignia illustrimn Poetarum recentiorum,
BaseL 1544, and in the famous Bucolicorum autores xxxviii
. . . farrago eclogarum clvi published by Oporinus‚ Basel⁷
1546. They are a rather close imitation of some of 1110
eclogues of *Faustus Andrelinus They show 011 11111111010
acquaintance with the eclogues of Calpurnius and Nemes-
ianus. And 01 10051 0110 passage, i, 41-42, 15 borrowed
from “ good old Mantuan ''.

35 In Victor Gueneau’s Dictionuaire biograplzique du A'Vivernais
(Nevers, 1899), p. 4, he 15 called “le premier regent du college de
Nevers''. But neither E. Duminy‚ Le Collbge de Nevers (1908),
nor C. A. Parmentier, Archives de Nevers (1842), mentions him
among the principals of that institution. They say that 111 1521 a
new school was opened at Nevers, that in 1526 this school was trans-
ferred to 0 new building and took the name of ‘college ³, and that
the first principal of the new college was Pierre Delafoi.

famille des imprimeurs lyonnais, originaire de Bourges, mais aucun
document, connu {1 ce jour, ne permet d’en preciser la parente”; J.
Baudrier, Bibliographie lyonnaise, x. 3 (Lyon, 1913).
