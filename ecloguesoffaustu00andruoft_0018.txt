patronage of many other eminent people-—of four chancel-
lors of France, Guillaume de Rochefort (d. Aug. 12, 1492),
Robert Briconnet (d. 1497), Guy de Rochefort (d. 1507),
and Jean de Ganay, of Thomas Ward, ambassador of the
King of England, and Pierre Cohardy or Courthardy (“ re-
gius advocatus ”. 14863 “primus Franciae praeses ’'‚ 1497;
d. 1505). Through the influence of Cohardy‚ he was
granted a royal pension, about 1496.6 On January 17, 1502,
he was granted letters of naturalization, by Louis XII. In
1505 116 was appointed canon of Bayeux.

poem which was published soon after his going to Paris
(c. 1495) “ad Faustum Andrelinum. quicum mihi tum
recens coierat sodalitas.” On May 2, 1499, he could write:
“cum Fausto 1111111 . . . 5111111113 familiaritas '³3 and the
statement is borne out by other letters written about that
time.8⁴ In 1500 Andrelinus wrote a commendatory letter
for the first edition of the Adagia. In a later edition of the

'¹'Another early friend at Paris who afterwards became distin-
guished was Guillaume Bude. In 1496 Andrelinus addressed to him
a short poem, Querela Parrlzisiensis pavimenti, the tone of which
implies a certain degree of intimacy with the recipient. It is quoted
by Ludwig Geiger‚ ‘ Publio Fausto Andrelini aus Forli ’, in Vierlel·

Andrelinus to join him in England and tells him of the pretty Eng-
lish girls and of the pleasant English custom of kissing on all ocea-
sions; Letters os Erasmus, ed. P. S. Allen, i. 238 (Oxford, 1906).
A sentence in this letter has been solemnly offered as one of the
sources of the legend of Dr. Faust, the famous magician and char-
latan of the 16111 century: “Quamquam si Britanniae dotes satis
pernosses, Fauste, nae tu alatis pedibus huc accurreres; et si podagra
tua non sineret, Daedalum te fieri optares.” To Herman Grimm
this was the earliest trace of the wide-spread belief in Faust’s ability
to fly through the air (Preuss. Jahrb„ xlvii. 456). See also Allen's
edition, i. 3, 221, 234, 235, 236, 297, 311.
